A basic demonstration of the logic behind the Monty Hall problem using Javascript.

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle inspired by an American television game show hosted by Monty Hall.

## Here’s how it works:
You’re a contestant on a game show and must choose one of three doors. Behind one door is a car; behind the other two are goats.

You select Door 1. The host, who knows what’s behind each door, then opens Door 3, revealing a goat.

The host then asks, “Would you like to stick with your original choice, or switch to the remaining unopened door?”

Is it to your advantage to switch?

This repository demonstrates the Monty Hall problem using JavaScript to prove the probability behind it.
